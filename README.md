# Node JS Simplified

## Introduction

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

This repository is a collection of notes and code snippets that I have written while learning Node.js. I hope you find it useful.

## What I learned: 

- Basics of Node js (Clients, Servers, Requests, Responses, Events, Modules, File System, Streams, Buffers, etc.)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Basics of Express js (Routing, Express Router, MVC, etc)
- Basics of MongoDB (MongoDb Atlas, CRUD operations, Mongoose, etc.)
- Basics of Template engines (Ejs, etc)

## About this Repository: 

All the codes inside this repository builds up a simple blog website which has mostly all the features of a CRUD application.

## How to use this Repository:

- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Run `nodemon ./Express-apps/app` to start the server
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the website

## Note:

- This repository is not a complete guide to Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It is just a collection of code snippets that I have written while learning these technologies.
